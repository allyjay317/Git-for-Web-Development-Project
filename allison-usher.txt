Stretch Questions

	block: <p>, <section>, <h1-6> 	inline: <a>, <img>	inline-block: <ul>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
	everything in html and css is basically in boxes, the entire page is boxed inside the <html> tag, and nested items all fit in boxes with widths and heights.
